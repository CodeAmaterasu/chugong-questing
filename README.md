# Chugong

## Description

Chugong makes life a game utilizing statistics and quests, just like in an adventure game. In this game, you are the main character. You can accept quests and questlines that give you experience points and thus your level and stats.

### Stats

Stats are used to measure your abilities. Currently, we support these categories:
* Strength
* Intelligence
* Endurance
* Charisma
* Vitality
* Dexterity

These stats are measured in levels and can be leveled through quests and questlines. There is no upper limit to the level!

### Quests

A quest describes a task for the player. Each quest rewards the player in experience points for his stats. A quest can only give out experience points in three different categories. Quests can be replayed multiple times.

### Questlines

Is a collection of quests. On completing a questline, the player is rewarded with bonus experience points. Questlines can be replayed multiple times.

### Marketplace

There is a player lead marketplace for users to upload and download their favorite quests!
